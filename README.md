<br>
Interactive tenzies game made with React.

This is part of a project of the Scrimba [free React course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact).
<br>
I added couple of features to the project which includes:

- User login (no database, totally offline)
- Choose game difficulty
- Saving best player to localStorage
- And getting best player from localStorage.

Feel free to folk/clone to add more features.

**Made with excitment :)**
